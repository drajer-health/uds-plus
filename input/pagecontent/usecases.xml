  <h3>Use Story1: Health centers submit data using FHIR APIs</h3>
  <p>
    Federally Qualified Health Centers' (FQHCs) EHRs have recorded patient data that fall under UDS reporting requirements. An internal timer on the BSA triggers a series of bulk FHIR requests that cover the encounters since the last reporting period. The BSA sends a series of requests to cover FHIR resources based on eligible patients and time parameters. The EHR notifies the BSA when the data is ready. The BSA invokes trust services to anonymize, pseudonymize, de-identify resources as required. The trust services anonymize, pseudonymize, de-identify resources as required. Trust services notifies the BSA that required operations are complete. BSA notifies HRSA that the resource files are ready and provides location.
