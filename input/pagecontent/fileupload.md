### Context

#### Pre-reading
Before reading this formal specification, implementers should first be familiar with two other key portions of the specification:

* The [Use Cases](usecases.html) page provides the business context and general process flow enabled by the formal specification.

* The [Background](background.html) page provides information about the underlying specifications and indicates what portions of each should be reviewed in order to have the necessary foundation to understand the constraints and usage guidance described in this detailed specification.


#### Conventions
This implementation guide uses specific terminology to flag statements that have relevance for the evaluation of conformance with the guide:

* **SHALL** indicates requirements that must be met to be conformant with the specification.

* **SHOULD** indicates behaviors that are strongly recommended (and which may result in interoperability issues or sub-optimal behavior if not adhered to), but which do not, for this version of the specification, affect the determination of specification conformance.

* **MAY** describes optional behaviors that are free to consider but where the is no recommendation for or against adoption.


#### Claiming Conformance 

Actors and Systems asserting conformance to this implementation guide have to implement the requirements outlined in the corresponding capability statements. The following definition of MUST SUPPORT is to be used in the implementation of the requirements.
